## üîÑ Complete Workflow

### Customer Checkout Process
1. **Add Items to Cart**: Customer adds products to cart
2. **Initiate Checkout**: Click "Checkout" button on cart page
3. **Fill Customer Info**: CheckoutModal collects:
   - Customer details (name, email, mobile)
   - Shipping address (street, city, state, zip, country)
4. **Submit Order**: Order created with PENDING status
5. **Await Approval**: Order waits for admin approval

### Admin Order Management Process
1. **View Orders**: Admin accesses order management dashboard
2. **Filter Orders**: Filter by status (PENDING, APPROVED, etc.)
3. **Review Order**: View customer info, items, and total
4. **Approve/Reject**: 
   - **Approve**: Stock is reduced, order moves to APPROVED
   - **Reject**: Order marked as REJECTED with reason
5. **Track Progress**: Update status through fulfillment pipeline
6. **Monitor Analytics**: View sales statistics and trends
